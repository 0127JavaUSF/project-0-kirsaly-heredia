# Banking Application - Project 0 - Kirsaly Heredia

-------------------------------------
Project Description
-------------------------------------
This project will consist of a Java application and supporting database used to implement common functionality for a banking service. You can imagine this as a portal to represent either ATM like interactions, or an application a bank teller might use to interact with the banking system.  Users will interact with this application using the command line and providing responses using IO operations that support reading keyboard input (Scanner, Console, etc).

Projects should be designated a theme and that theme should be used to define how the requirements are interpreted and implemented. Some example themes include:
1.	Scrooge McDucks Swimming Pool Bank.
2.	CryptoBank


-------------------------------------
Functional Requirements
-------------------------------------
Application must support the following functionalities: 
- Users should be able to create an account
- Users should be able to log in to an account with a correct username and password.
- Users should be able to create checking/savings accounts under their account.
- Accounts should support:
  -	Standard single-user accounts
  -	Joint accounts (multi user) with any number of users
-	Users should be able to deposit to a specified account.
-	Users should be able to withdraw from an account.
-	Users should be able to conduct a balance check on an account
-	Users should be able to transfer money from one account to another account.
-	Users should be able to close an account.
-	Users should be able to retrieve data between login sessions and application execution.


-------------------------------------
Technology Requirements
-------------------------------------
Application technology stack should consist of:
-	Java application
-	Maven Project
-	JUnit tests covering service layer
-	PostgreSQL Database for persistence


-------------------------------------
Content Requirements
-------------------------------------
Application should include:
-	A clear and unique theme - don’t just make a bank, make it an interesting bank.
-	Organized and easy to understand output
  -	Feedback should be provided so the user understands the current state of the application
  -	Output should be organized so that it’s easy to process - for instance an accounts summary should probably be listed in some kind of table format


-------------------------------------
Project Workflow
-------------------------------------
-	Plan architecture
  -	Decide what classes will exist and their relationships in operation
-	Test Driven Development:
  -	Write tests covering logical layer of application
-	Implement Functionality 
  -	Implement functionality until tests pass
